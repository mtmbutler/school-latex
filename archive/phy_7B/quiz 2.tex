Sir Lost-a-Lot dons his armor and sets out from the castle on his trusty steed. Unfortunately, his squire lowered the draw bridge too far, stopping it at $20^\circ$ below the horizontal. Lost-a-Lot and his horse stop when their combined center of mass is $1\phantom{.}\text{m}$ from the end of the bridge. The bridge is $8\phantom{.}\text{m}$ long and has a mass of $2000\phantom{.}\text{kg}$. The lift cable is attached to the bridge $5\phantom{.}\text{m}$ from the hinge at the castle end and to a point on the castle wall $12\phantom{.}\text{m}$ above the bridge. Lost-a-Lot's mass combined with that of his armor and steed is $1000\phantom{.}\text{kg}$.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item Determine the tension in the cable.
    \vfill
    \item Determine the pivot force that the hinge exerts on the bridge.
    \vfill
\end{enumerate}
